      <h3>Legacy App Upgrade</h3>
      <p>
        Is the Rails app powering your business on life support (or at least
        long term support)? Does it seem impossible to upgrade? Don't fall for
        the big rewrite. Your app has years of insider knowledge baked into
        it. We will transition it into the modern age safely.
