    <p>
      We help businesses with production apps that are in trouble. When the app
      isn't stable, the infrastructure is unreliable, adding features is too
      difficult or you can't upgrade, it's time for a rescue.

      <h3>Modernize Legacy Apps</h3>
      <p>
        Is the Rails app powering your business perpetually in maintenance
        mode? Are you stuck with an unsupported version of Ruby or an
        outdated release of Rails?  Don't fall for the big rewrite! Your app
        has years of insider knowledge. We'll help you transition it into the
        modern age safely.

      <h3>Rescue a Project</h3>
      <p>
        In the early days your app saw new features added quickly and easily.
        However, increasingly the team's time is dominated by fighting bugs,
        performance fixes, and perpetual "refactoring". The project needs to
        be rescued. We'll help you get things back to the salad days.

      <h3>Stabilize Infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
        Has the fear of unplanned downtime made deploying new code infrequent
        and nerve-wracking? With the right processes in place your app can be
        deployed continuously as bug fixes are made and features are ready.
        We'll put the systems in place to make your platform stable.

      <h3>Break Up a Monolith</h3>
      <p>
        Monolithic apps are ideal when starting a project, but as they mature
        they balloon in complexity and become a drain on the team. We'll lead
        you to a more maintainable project by extracting performance critical
        modules, spinning discrete subsystems out into services, and layering
        independent client side apps.
