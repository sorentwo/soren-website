      <h3>Modernize Legacy Apps</h3>
      <p>
        Over time the Rails app powering your business can drift into
        maintenance mode. You may get stuck on a vulnerable version of Ruby or
        an outdated release of Rails. Resist the temptation to rewrite it!
        We'll help you transition the years of knowledge and effort baked into
        your app into the modern age safely.

      <h3>Break Up a Monolith</h3>
      <p>
        Monolithic apps are ideal when starting a project, but as they mature
        they balloon in complexity and become a drain on the team. We'll lead
        you to a more maintainable project by extracting performance critical
        modules, spinning discrete subsystems out into services, and layering
        independent client side apps.

      <h3>Stabilize Infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
        Has the fear of unplanned downtime made deploying new code infrequent
        and nerve-wracking? With the right processes in place your app can be
        deployed continuously as bug fixes are made and features are ready.
        We'll put the systems in place to make your platform stable.
      </p>

    <div class="services-item">
      <img src="/assets/rescue.jpg">
      <h3>Rescue a Project</h3>
      <p>
        When the app isn't stable, infrastructure is irritable, adding new
        features is too difficult, or you simply can't upgrade, it's time for a
        rescue. We'll coax your project back to a state where the team can
        focus on adding features instead of constantly fighting bugs and
        wrestling with architecture.
