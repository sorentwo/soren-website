# Is a slow Rails app hurting your business?

* Are customers losing time (and sanity) waiting for pages to load?
* Have you lost conversions because pages load too slowly?
* Are you hemorrhaging sales because the app feels sluggish?
* Is the business growing while the servers fail to keep up?
* Have your business partners complained that your app is slow and unreliable?

There's an answer, and throwing more hardware or developers at the problem isn't it.

**Rails can be blazing fast with caching!**

Caching is vital to any fast production application.
It **makes your app faster** by letting it doing less work.
Whether that means pages are built once and shared, or that content is served from geographically closer locations, customers will **feel the difference**.

Caching is a broad topic with a lot of nuance.
We'll help you identify what is holding your app back and where to apply caching to speed it up using techniques like:

* Caching Headers
* Page & Asset Compression
* Page Caching
* API Caching
* Russian Doll Caching
* Content Expiration Strategies
* Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
* Optimizing Infrastructure

A **3&times;—4&times;** improvement in page load times is common, and we've seen improvements up to **10&times;**.

With a slow site your business is leaving money on the table.
Regain customer trust and increase profits by getting your application fast again.

## Interested? Here's what we'll do together.

Within **3 days** of kickoff we'll generate a performance prescription report diagnosing *precisely* what is making your application so slow.
The report identifies layers of slowdown and where caching, tuning and performance can be improved.
Each step of the report prescribes a plan of attack, starting with the changes that will have the biggest impact.

1. A **30 minute** onboarding call to discuss your current pain points
2. Application audit to generate an **actionable** performance report
3. Prescription of specific changes, fixes and optimizations to speed the app up
4. A follow up **7 days** after completion

Price **$1,500**, no fees or variable rates.
